# block-faller
Final project for Data Structures and Abstraction. This is a little Java game where the goal is to survive as long as possible. There are enemies to avoid (instant death), and touching the bottom or top of the screen ends the game. As time goes on the speed of platforms changes as well as the amount of platforms. Harder difficulties amplify this. Uses node based linked lists to create all the platforms and monsters.
